# Security By Design Projektentwurf

Dies ist der Projektentwurf f√ºr den Kurs Security by Design.

## Building the Project

### Installation of Requirements

```bash
# optional
python3 -m venv env
./env/bin/activate
# requirements
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Start the Application

Before starting the application you have to migrate the Django database schema.
You can do that with the following command.

```bash
cd ./kundenportal/kp_app/
python3 manage.py migrate
```

```bash
bash -c run.sh
# or
./run.sh
```

### Start the Application in a secure manner

1. Generate a SSL certificate with OpenSSL

```bash
# generate ssl key and cert
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -sha256 -days 365
# remove the encryption from the key because gunicorn does not support that (yes that is unsecure
# you should normally not do that; just for the presentation of the project here)
openssl rsa -in key.pem -out easy_key.pem
```

Please keep in mind that the key is not signed and you browser will warn you about that.
You could sign the key with the help of [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/).

2. Edit the settings for the Django server to be secure.

```python
DEBUG = False
ALLOWED_HOSTS = [".localhost", "127.0.0.1", "[::1]"]
# ...
# === Security Settings ===
# NOTE: this is a low value for testing can be higher in production please keep
# that value at 0 because the browser cache is memorizing that value you cannot
# switch between only ssl and an insecure connection without deleting the browser
# cache
SECURE_HSTS_SECONDS = 0
SECURE_HSTS_INCLUDE_SUBDOMAINS = True # this should be set to true in production
SECURE_HSTS_PRELOAD = True # this should be set to true in production
SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT =  True # this should be set to true in production
SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE = True # this should be set to true
CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE = True # this should be set to true
```

[What are those settins](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.0/topics/security/)

3. move the `easy_key.pem` and `cert.pem` file into the `kp_app` dir

```bash
bash -c run_sec.sh
# or
./run_sec.sh
```

## Info for Test Users

Test users have to be create manually. Go to `/singup` and enter some nice mock
infos. If you want to have some mock data as well look at the "test auth keys"
that are displayed when starting the Messstellenbetreiber Server and enter one
of them in the sing up mask. Now just log in your user.
