  <p>
    Creating password rules with a specific password length requirement but
    avoiding other strict criteria can indeed increase password entropy and make
    your system more secure. However, it's essential to strike a balance between
    security and user convenience. Here's why you might choose not to specify
    additional password rules when enforcing a 10-character length:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>User-Friendly Approach:</strong> Many users find strict password
      rules cumbersome and frustrating. By only requiring a 10-character minimum
      length, you strike a balance between security and user-friendliness,
      making it easier for individuals to create and remember their passwords.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Diverse Passwords:</strong> With a focus on length rather than a
      complex mix of character types, users may naturally create more diverse
      passwords. Longer passwords are typically harder to guess, and they may
      include a variety of characters, further enhancing security.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Less Risk of Forgotten Passwords:</strong> Complex rules can lead
      to forgotten passwords, which often results in users having to reset their
      passwords or contact support. By keeping it simple with a 10-character
      minimum, users are less likely to forget their passwords, reducing the
      need for password recovery.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Resilience Against Dictionary Attacks:</strong> While not
      specifying rules like requiring special characters or numbers may make
      brute force attacks more manageable, it also makes dictionary attacks less
      effective. Longer passwords that don't follow a specific pattern can be
      significantly more resistant to dictionary-based cracking attempts.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Adaptability:</strong> Users often use the same passwords across
      multiple accounts. By allowing them to choose their preferred 10-character
      combination, you encourage them to create unique passwords for your
      system, increasing security across the board.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Educational Value:</strong> When users are allowed to create their
      own passwords, they may become more aware of what constitutes a strong
      password. This educational aspect can lead to better password practices
      beyond your system.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Reduced Burden on Support:</strong> Complex password rules often
      lead to users seeking help when they can't create or remember their
      passwords. By simplifying your requirements, you reduce the burden on your
      support team.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Customization:</strong> Some users may have their unique
      strategies for creating strong and memorable passwords. Allowing them to
      choose their own password format empowers them to use their methods while
      still adhering to a minimum length requirement.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    While specific password rules can increase security, opting for a
    10-character minimum length without further restrictions can be a pragmatic
    choice, striking a balance between security and user experience. It
    encourages users to create strong and diverse passwords while also reducing
    the potential for frustrating experiences and support inquiries.
